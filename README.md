# Repository Overview 
This repository includes all of the Java projects that I completed during my internship at InMobiles. It is composed of three Eclipse workspaces, <br>
> `ServerWorkspace` which contains all the server programs that I developed <br>
> `ClientWorkspace` which contains all the client applications that interact with the servers <br>
> `OtherWorkspace ` which contains all Java exercises that do not require client-server implementation <br>

Below is a table that associates each client program to its server:
| Client | Server |
| ------ | ------ |
| TCPclient | TCPserver |
| UDPclient | UDPserver |
| - | RemoteServer |
| GroupChatClient | GroupChatServer |
| GroupChatClientK | GroupChatServerK |
| ClientWebAPI | ServerWebAPI <br> ServerWebAPI-DB |
